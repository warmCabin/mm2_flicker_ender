# Rockman 2 Flicker Ender

Reimplements a few of Rockman 2's drawing routines in Lua to overcome the 64-sprite limitation. The goal of this script is to draw the exact tiles the game would have drawn if OAM was infinite.

The tiledraw script is more general purpose, and could be reused for a project like this for a different game.
