# Rockman 2 Flicker Ender

Reimplements a few of Rockman 2's drawing routines in Lua to overcome the 64-sprite limitation. The goal of this script is to draw the exact tiles the game would have drawn if OAM was infinite.

Only compatible with **Rockman 2** for now. Not Mega Man 2, not Super Mario Bros. 2., not Rockman 3. Just Rockman 2. Mega Man 2 support should eventually be possible. The tiledraw script is more general purpose, and could be reused for a project like this for a different game.
